# ✋ PF2 Send to Hand (aka Item Header Management)

This mod adds to item dialogs of items that are in the player inventory a way to equip or unequip them from the item dialog header. This method allows TAH to open items with right-click and then change their state from the item dialog.

- This mod only works for item dialogs of items that are in the inventory of tokens you are owner, or all for the GM.
- The mod adds a new button in the item header, an icon and a string, depending if the item is equipped or not. Pressing the header button changes the state of the item’s equipment.
